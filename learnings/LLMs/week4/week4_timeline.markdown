## Day 1: Multimodal Learning – Text and Image (Monday, June 16, Completed June 18)
- **Task**: Read CLIP paper (20 mins), fine-tuned CLIP on `RIW/small-coco` (40 mins).
- **Output**: Accuracy: 100% on 5 text-image pairs. Used 200 train samples.
- **Correction**: Validate with 5 new pairs to confirm generalizability.

## Day 2: Evaluation Metrics for LLMs (Tuesday, June 17, Completed June 18)
- **Task**: Read BLEU/ROUGE paper (20 mins), evaluated GPT-2 stories (40 mins).
- **Output**: Story 1: BLEU: 0.000, ROUGE-L: 0.089; Story 2: 0.000, 0.108; Story 3: 0.000, 0.101.
- **Correction**: Consider qualitative review for creative tasks.

## Day 3: Advanced Optimization – Pruning (Wednesday, June 18, 7:00–8:00 PM IST)
- **Task**: Read pruning guide (20 mins), pruned DistilBERT (40 mins).
- **Output**: Original Size: 803.59 MB, Pruned Size: 267.84 MB (66.7% reduction). Accuracy: 50.2% (30%), 50% (2%).
